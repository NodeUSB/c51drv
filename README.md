c51drv
======

An 8051 microcontroller peripheral library.

How to use
----------

If you are using Linux with [sdcc](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net)
installed, use `make` to compile all the modules and test cases.  This
library should also work with Keil C51, however, you need to import
the source code into a Keil C51 project manually.
